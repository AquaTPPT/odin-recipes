# odin-recipes

So far I am doing The Odin Project classes. Decided to do the introduction, in case my other course had missed a spot or two. 
I may not have learned much about HTML and CSS yet, but I have learned a ton about using VSC, GitHub and Linux, mostly things I wouldn't even think of looking up until I was actually faced with them in an interview or something.
not much else I can say :)
